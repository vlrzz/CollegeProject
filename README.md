Hi guys
There is nothing interesting here if you are not familiar with me and my project. I don't care about this project, I need it just to finish the 1st year of college, bye.
(The code is written with working tasks, but I wrote it as lazily as possible, if someone doesn't like the way I wrote it - bro, I don't care about it, I have other projects in which I have a desire to put my soul, skill and experience)
